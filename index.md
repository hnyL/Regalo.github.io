# SPACE-STATION TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM


## Alfa-Romeo Regalo

Regalo is a conceptual design facing on the requirement of ferrying between different space stations.

You can take a brief view on [TJU Industial Design Galary](http://idesign.tju.edu.cn/exhibitions/index/work_detail/id/195/type/biye.html) to maintain a direct insight to the design and the intelligent designer, Lorraine Jade.

The design can be deparated into three parts of exterior, interior and human-machine. These three sections are organically correlated but remains their own specific and unique features.
